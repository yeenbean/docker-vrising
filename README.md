# docker-vrising

> üí° This is a fork of [Mephi00/v-rising-wine-docker-image](https://github.com/Mephi00/v-rising-wine-docker-image). For now, I'm leaving the original readme below intact. However, here are some notable changes that I'll be making:
> - [x] docker-compose.yml builds image instead of pulling image. This is optional as the container will automatically update the game server with each redeploy, and I've left the original reference to the image if you prefer.
> - [ ] Additional scripts to automate server resets via crontab. This allows for more granular control of the server wipe schedule compared to the built-in method. **Please see information below to effectively use this feature.**
> - [ ] Ansible deployment, and possibly Terraform because I want to learn it.

This docker image is supposed to run a v rising server.
At the time of writing the server is only available as a windows executable.
This project therefore uses wine to run the server.

The image is available on [docker hub (mephi00/v-rising-wine)](https://hub.docker.com/r/mephi00/v-rising-wine).

# Setting up the container

In order to access the Server, you need to expose the specified server port on the udp protocol. In docker this is achieved by the argument _-p \<external port>:\<server port>/udp_. For the server to be visible on the public listing, the query port has to be exposed by the udp protocol as well. This is achieved the same way as described above. <br>
Addionally, the afore mentioned ports have to be publicly exposed in your router settings.<br>
If you want the public listing to work properly, please make sure, that the ports are the same on the container and on the host.<br>
For an example docker compose file please take a look [here](./docker-compose.yaml)
<br>

Please note, that upon first start up, the server initialises the world, which takes about 10 minutes, maybe longer. Additionally, the container begins by updating the game server, so you are not relying on a new image in order to update the server to a new version. This also takes some time, so don't panic when your server isn't immediately available.

# Configurations

The server can be configured using environment variables or by providing configuration files

## Using environment variables

## Using configuration files

For a fully custom experience, providing your own setting files is recommended. <br>
The files _ServerGameSettings.json_ and _ServerHostSettings.json_ must be present in the folder _/saves/Settings/_.
You can mount a folder to _/saves/Settings_ or just add the _Settings_ subfolder to your _/saves_ mount. <br>
If they aren't present, the environment variables are used for configuration.<br><br>
Providing a settings file only partly will not work and the server will start with default settings.

\***\*Please beware, when using a mix of settings files and environment variables for a configuration, that the settings will not be adjusted when changing the environment variables. If you want to change the settings accordingly, delete the file from the _/saves/Settings_ folder.\*\***

### Example files

Example files can be found [here](./examples), these contain the default settings by Stunlock Studios.

# Save File Location

The Save folder is /saves. In order to have access to the save files for an easy backup, mount a folder to /saves, the save files are located in the _Saves_ subfolder and the configuration files are saved in the subfolder _Settings_.<br>
The mount option can also be used to transfer your save files from a different installation or playthrough. For this to work be aware of the folder structure and, that the save name has to be set to your added save state.

# adminlist.txt and banlist.txt
The adminlist.txt and banlist.txt files are located in the _/saves/Settings_ folder. In there you can add your steamid to become and admin or add a steamid to the banlist.
